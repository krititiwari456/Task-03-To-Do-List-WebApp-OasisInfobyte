This  is the task 3 from level 2 of web development from OasisInfobyte. In this task I have to create a to-do-list that contains all the tasks of the person that they want to compltete in a particular day or time and according to their completoon of the tasks they can delete the task from the to-do-list.
To-Do-List makes the tasks of the person easier as in a way they will not forget the tasks they have have to complete and can be beneficial to all. This task is done on Visual Studio Code using the languages HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
Hope you all will like this project. Thank You!!
